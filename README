R4ARCH - R for Archaeologists

This is an R (www.r-project) project integrated with Statistics for Archaeologists (2nd Ed.), designed to make the methods described in the book easier to implement in R.

Development Path
Initially, an .R file, or series of .R files will be created to implement functions not otherwise available in R (ie, Drennen's version of winsorization, or the trimmed standard deviation).  Ultimately, I intend to make this available as an R package, ideally through CRAN (cran.r-project.org), to encourage the use of R within the archaeological community.
The final stage in main development will be the creation of a GUI, to assist those less technologically savvy archaeologists in using this tool set.
