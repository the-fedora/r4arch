Versioning:  each chapter gets a version, per below.  array R4ARCHVER is set to reflect version status:
	VER:	the numeric version corresponding to a chapter.  All functions defined up to that chapter should work, but TODO items may not be finished.
	ALPHA:	if TRUE, then VER chapter is 'work in progress,' and not all of the functions for that VER are working yet.  If FALSE, chapter is complete and tested, and all functions for that VER should work properly, but TODO items may hot be complete.
	RC:	Below VER 1.0, RC=0.  At VER 1.0 and above, RC indicates 'release candidate' status.  If RC is numeric, ALPHA must be TRUE.  RC will be updated as testing continues and changes are made until everything listed under the chapter subsections works properly together, at which point RC=FALSE, and ALPHA=FALSE, this indicates 'final' version 1.0.  This system will be used after VER 1.0 as TODOs and other improvements are made, each improvement will increment the minor version, testing changes increment RC, RC=FALSE,ALPHA=FALSE denotes finished product for defined minor version increment.
Minor versioning will increment after 1.0 in discrete packages of improvement, initally likely to follow the TODO list.  Ditto for post 2.0

CHAPTER 1 (v0.04)
Stem/Leaf plots
	require aplpack
		replace with something that doesn't use tcltk later?
	TODO
		simplify stem.leaf?

CHAPTER 2 (v0.08)
	Indices of central tendencies, including trimmed mean, are in R-base.
	A "stem-mode" function is provided by r4arch.stemmode().
	TODO:
		make r4arch.stemmode() recognize minor modes
		update trimmed mean to use rounding like Drennan
CHAPTER 3 (v0.12)
	r4arch.range <- subtract out R's range to give commonly understood range
	r4arch.quartiles <- follow Drennan's explanation of quartiles more closely
	r4arch.iqr <- use values from r4arch.quartiles for IQR calculation
	Standard Deviation is provided for in R-base
	r4arch.winsor <- use simple Winsorization after Drennan (see also Matrix example in help intro)
	r4arch.winsor.sd <- winsorized std dev after Drennan.  Make sure to use winsorized variance, ie var(r4arch.winsor)
	r4arch.indexpair <- calculate one or all of the index pairs, ie median & IQR, mean & std dev, trimmed mean & trimmed std dev, using r4arch functions where necessary
	TODO:
		fix rounding behavior!
